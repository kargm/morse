Well done!
Now you can start moving your avatar around:

For moving forward press <W> key.
You can move sideways with the keys <A> and <D>. 
By pressing the key <S> you move your avatar 
towards the camera.
Please notice that the movement direction 
is dependent on the orientation of the camera 
and not of the avatar itself. 
Therefore it is convenient to use the mouse
for rotating your avatar during movement.

Please go through the doorframe now.
