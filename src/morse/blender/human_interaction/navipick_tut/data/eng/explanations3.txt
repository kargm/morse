Good job!

As you can see, the first doorframe 
(your avatar just passed) disappeared 
and simultaneously a second doorframe just showed up.

Now navigate your avatar through all appearing 
doorframes one after the other.

If you want your avatar to move faster
you can press the <SHIFT> key in addition to
the movement keys presented previously.
