To pick up something, you have to move your
avatar close to the object and move the crosshairs
above it.

An open hand and the name of the object appears. 

If this is not the case the 
object is out of reach. 

Press the <left mouse button> to 
pick up the obejct. If the object is on the floor 
the avatar will automatically bend down.
Note that it is only possible
to carry one object at a time. 

Now you can pick up the yellow cup from the table!
